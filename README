# 🧠 HR Analytics-Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts employee attrition using HR analytics and machine learning. It identifies key risk factors and helps HR teams take proactive retention measures.

## 📂 Dataset Features
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status
- **Job Details**: Department, Job Role, Years at Company, OverTime
- **Satisfaction Metrics**: Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance
- **Compensation**: Monthly Income, Percent Salary Hike
- **Target**: Attrition (Yes/No)

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Encoded categorical variables (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)
- Scaled features using StandardScaler

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized attrition trends by department, age group, and job role
- Used heatmaps and boxplots to identify key drivers
- Found OverTime and low satisfaction as major risk factors

### 3. Model Building
- Trained classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

### 4. Insights & Business Impact
- OverTime, low Job Satisfaction, and poor Work-Life Balance strongly correlate with attrition
- Suggested HR interventions for high-risk segments
- Enabled data-driven retention strategies

## 📊 Dashboard (Optional)
- Attrition by Department
- Satisfaction vs Attrition
- Monthly Income Distribution
- Risk Score by Employee Segment

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI / Tableau (if dashboard included)
